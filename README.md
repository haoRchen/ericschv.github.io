The aim of this project was to build a web game based on the popular board game 'Jenga'. The application was built in collaboration with haoRchen. The three.js library was used to create 3D objects that could be easily manipulated. In order to simulate real-time physics, this project also utilizes the physijs plugin. This plugin makes it easier to implement physics on 3D objects.
